Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.	ncit:C1326

Although its mechanism of action is incompletely defined, amsacrine may intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks, arrest of the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, and cell death. This agent's cytotoxicity is maximal during the S phase of the cell cycle when topoisomerase levels are greatest.

However, this antibody could be utilized to deliver a conjugated cytotoxic agent to GPNMB-expressing tumor cells. GPNMB, overexpressed on the surface of various cancer cells, plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation.	ncit:C84520		
PD							Denosumab	os_v1.2|os_v1.1|os_v1.0	A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) with antiosteoclast activity. Denosumab specifically binds to RANKL and blocks the interaction of RANKL with RANK, a receptor located on osteoclast cell surfaces, resulting in inhibition of osteoclast activity, a decrease in bone resorption, and a potential increase in bone mineral density. RANKL, a protein expressed by osteoblastic cells, plays an important role in osteoclastic differentiation and activation.	ncit:C61313		
PD							Dinutuximab	os_v1.2|os_v1.1|os_v1.0	A chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody with potential antineoplastic activity. Dinutuximab binds to the ganglioside GD2 and induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against GD2-expressing tumor cells. GD2 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung.	ncit:C1570		
PD							Interferon	os_v1.2|os_v1.1|os_v1.0	Human interferons have been classified into 3 groups: alpha, beta, and gamma. Both alpha- and beta-IFNs, previously designated type I, are acid-stable, but they differ immunologically and in regard to some biologic and physiochemical properties. The IFNs produced by virus-stimulated leukocytes (leukocyte IFNs) are predominantly of the alpha type. Those produced by lymphoblastoid cells are about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts produce mainly or exclusively the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ widely in amino acid sequence. The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens or to antigens to which they are sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs. (from OMIM 147570)	ncit:C20493		
PD							Docetaxel	os_v1.2|os_v1.1|os_v1.0	A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata. Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response. Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. (NCI04)	ncit:C1526

Disease limited to one side of the diaphragm, (the muscle separating the chest from the abdomen), defines stage II. Stage III patients have disease on both sides of the diaphragm and stage IV patients once again have disseminated disease. Consideration of involvement of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow are also considered in this system. Finally, the stage is subdivided into categories of A and B depending on the presence of symptoms of itching, weight loss, fever, and night sweats.

PD							Sodium Thiosulfate	gct_v1.2|gct_v1.1|gct_v1.0	A water soluble salt and reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing agents.  Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, thiosulfate likely provides an exogenous source of sulfur, thereby hastening the detoxification of cyanide through the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate cyanide sulfurtransferase) which converts cyanide to the relatively nontoxic, excretable thiocyanate ion. In addition, this agent neutralizes the reactive alkylating species of nitrogen mustard, thereby decreasing skin toxicity related to nitrogen mustard extravasation. (NCI04)	ncit:C1230		
PD							Dexrazoxane	hl_v1.0	A bisdioxopiperazine with iron-chelating, chemoprotective, cardioprotective, and antineoplastic activities. After hydrolysis to an active form that is similar to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), dexrazoxane chelates iron, limiting the formation of free radical-generating anthracycline-iron complexes, which may minimize anthracycline-iron complex-mediated oxidative damage to cardiac and soft tissues. This agent also inhibits the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II, which may result in tumor cell growth inhibition.	ncit:C1333		
PD							Systemic Corticosteroid	hl_v1.0	Treatment with corticosteroids via a delivery method that will affect the entire body (oral, intramuscular, intravenous).	ncit:C122080		
PD							Topical Corticosteroid	hl_v1.0	Any synthetic steroid derivative exhibiting the same function as the naturally occurring corticosteroid hormone, formulated for topical application. Topical corticosteroids are applied to the skin where it exerts its effect, however, corticosteroids can be absorbed systemically after being applied locally. Topical corticosteroids are mainly used for the localized treatment of inflammation of the skin and help relieve symptoms such as itching, swelling and redness.	ncit:C29505		
PD							Non-Corticosteroid Immunosuppressive Agent	hl_v1.0	An immunosuppressive agent that is not a corticosteroid.	ncit:C185652		
PD							Erythropoeitin	hl_v1.0	Erythropoietin (193 aa, ~21 kDa) is encoded by the human EPO gene. This protein plays a role in both erythropoiesis and the maintenance of red blood cell volume.	ncit:C20429		
PD							Filgrastim	hl_v1.0	A recombinant, non-glycosylated cytokine which is chemically identical to or similar to the endogenous cytokine human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) isoform B, with immunomodulating activity. Filgrastim binds to and activates G-CSF receptors with the same biological activity and stability as the endogenous cytokine, thereby controlling the production, differentiation, and function of neutrophilic granulocyte progenitors.	ncit:C1474		
PD							PEG-filgrastim	hl_v1.0	A long-acting pegylated form of a recombinant therapeutic agent which is chemically identical to or similar to an endogenous human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Produced endogenously by monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, G-CSF binds to and activates specific cell surface receptors, stimulating neutrophil progenitor proliferation and differentiation and selected neutrophil functions. Conjugation of the cytokine with a branched polyethylene glycol molecule (pegylation) significantly increases its therapeutic half-life. (NCI04)	ncit:C1854		
PD							Morphine	hl_v1.0	An opiate alkaloid isolated from the plant Papaver somniferum and produced synthetically. Morphine binds to and activates specific opiate receptors (delta, mu and kappa), each of which are involved in controlling different brain functions. In the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems, this agent exhibits widespread effects including analgesia, anxiolysis, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal system smooth muscle contraction. (NCI04)	ncit:C62051		
PD							Gabapentin	hl_v1.0	A synthetic analogue of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid with anticonvulsant activity. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, gabapentin appears to inhibit excitatory neuron activity. This agent also exhibits analgesic properties. (NCI04)	ncit:C1108		
PD							Thyroid Hormone Replacement	hl_v1.0	The sodium salt of levothyroxine, a synthetic levoisomer of thyroxine (T4) that is similar to the endogenous hormone produced by the thyroid gland. In peripheral tissues, levothyroxine is deiodinated by 5'-deiodinase to form triiodothyronine (T3). T3 enters the cell and binds to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors; the activated hormone-receptor complex in turn triggers gene expression and produces proteins required in the regulation of cellular respiration; thermogenesis; cellular growth and differentiation; and the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. T3 also exhibits cardiostimulatory effects.	ncit:C888		
PD							Plerixafor	hl_v1.0	A bicyclam with hematopoietic stem cell-mobilizing activity. Plerixafor blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1alpha) to the cellular receptor CXCR4, resulting in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) release from bone marrow and HSC movement into the peripheral circulation.	ncit:C1777

This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.	ncit:C66876

Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.	ncit:C68814		
PD							Pembroluzimab	hl_v1.0	A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.	ncit:C106432		
PD							Prednisone	hl_v1.0	A synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.

This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor cell populations.	ncit:C770		
PD							Procarbazine	hl_v1.0	A methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic activities. Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated, procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation, resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through an alkylation reaction.	ncit:C62072		
PD							Thiotepa	hl_v1.0	A polyfunctional, organophosphorus alkylating agent and a stable derivative of N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA), with antineoplastic activity.
