PD						Amsacrine	An aminoacridine derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. Although its mechanism of action is incompletely defined, amsacrine may intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks, arrest of the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, and cell death. This agent's cytotoxicity is maximal during the S phase of the cell cycle when topoisomerase levels are greatest. In addition, amsacrine may induce transcription of tumor promoter p53 protein and block p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, resulting in p53-dependent tumor cell apoptosis.	ncit:C240		
PD						Arsenic Trioxide	A small-molecule arsenic compound with antineoplastic activity. The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. This agent causes damage to or degradation of the promyelocytic leukemia protein/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARa) fusion protein; induces apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and in many other tumor cell types; promotes cell differentiation and suppresses cell proliferation in many different tumor cell types; and is pro-angiogenic.

PD						Bortezomib	A dipeptide boronic acid analogue with antineoplastic activity. Bortezomib reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex that degrades ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.	ncit:C1851

PD						Cytarabine	An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose).	ncit:C408		
PD						Daunorubicin	An anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic with therapeutic effects similar to those of doxorubicin. Daunorubicin exhibits cytotoxic activity through topoisomerase-mediated interaction with DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis.	ncit:C62091		
PD						Daunorubicin (Liposomal)	A liposome-encapsulated form of the citrate salt of the anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic daunorubicin. Daunorubicin intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. Liposomal delivery of doxorubicin citrate improves drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects.	ncit:C2213		
PD						Doxorubicin	An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin.	ncit:C456		
PD						Etoposide	A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic properties, etoposide binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II	ncit:C491		
PD						Fludarabine	A fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity.	ncit:C1094		
PD						Gilteritinib	An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, STK1, or FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246), with potential antineoplastic activity. Gilteritinib binds to and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated forms of FLT3, AXL and ALK. This may result in an inhibition of FLT3, AXL, and ALK-mediated signal transduction pathways and reduces tumor cell proliferation in cancer cell types that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL and ALK, overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play a key role in tumor cell growth and survival.	ncit:C116722		
PD						Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate	The sodium salt of hydrocortisone succinate with glucocorticoid property. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is chemically similar to the endogenous hormone that stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, in addition to exhibiting minor mineralocorticoid effects. This agent binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and is translocated into the nucleus, where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, such as various cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent mediators of inflammation.	ncit:C1819		
PD						Idarubicin	A semisynthetic 4-demethoxy analogue of the antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin.	ncit:C562		
PD						Melphalan	A phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard with antineoplastic activity. Melphalan alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine and induces DNA inter-strand cross-linkages, resulting in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cytotoxicity against both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.	ncit:C633		
PD						Methotrexate	An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.	ncit:C642		
PD						Midostaurin	A synthetic indolocarbazole multikinase inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Midostaurin inhibits protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinases, which may result in disruption of the cell cycle, inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis in susceptible tumors.	ncit:C1872		
PD						Mitoxantrone	An anthracenedione antibiotic with antineoplastic activity.	ncit:C62050		
PD						Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin	A recombinant, humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody attached to the cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. In this conjugate, the antibody binds to and is internalized by tumor cells expressing CD33 antigen (a sialic acid-dependent glycoprotein commonly found on the surface of leukemic blasts), thereby delivering the attached calicheamicin to CD33-expressing tumor cells. Calicheamicin binds to the minor groove of DNA, causing double strand DNA breaks and resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis. (NCI04)	ncit:C1806		
PD						Quizartinib	An orally available small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. Quizartinib selectively inhibits class III receptor tyrosine kinases, including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3/STK1), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R/FMS), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR/KIT), and platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), resulting in inhibition of ligand-independent leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations in FLT3, resulting in constitutive activation, are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and occur in approximately one-third of AML cases.	ncit:C68936		
PD						Sorafenib	A synthetic compound targeting growth signaling and angiogenesis. Sorafenib blocks the enzyme RAF kinase, a critical component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that controls cell division and proliferation; in addition, sorafenib inhibits the VEGFR-2/PDGFR-beta signaling cascade, thereby blocking tumor angiogenesis.	ncit:C61948		
PD						Thiotepa	A polyfunctional, organophosphorus alkylating agent and a stable derivative of N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA), with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, thiotepa is converted into highly reactive ethylenimine groups, which covalently bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA and demonstrate a preference for the N7 position of guanine bases. This induces crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA, interferes with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.	ncit:C875		
PD						Tretinoin	A naturally-occurring acid of retinol. Tretinoin binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby inducing changes in gene expression that lead to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumorigenesis. This agent also inhibits telomerase, resulting in telomere shortening and eventual apoptosis of some tumor cell types. The oral form of tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic properties.	ncit:C900		
PD						Daunorubicin and Cytarabine (Liposomal)	A liposomal formulation containing a fixed combination of the antineoplastic agents cytarabine and daunorubicin in a 5:1 molar ratio. Liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine has been designed to provide optimal delivery of a specific ratio of cytarabine to daunorubicin, one that has been shown to be synergistic in vitro. The antimetabolite cytarabine competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis. This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. Daunorubicin, an intercalator and a topoisomerase II inhibitor, prevents DNA replication and inhibits protein synthesis. This agent also generates oxygen free radicals, resulting in the cytotoxic lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.	ncit:C67504
