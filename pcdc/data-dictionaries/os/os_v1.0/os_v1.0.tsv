Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.	ncit:C1326

The multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors are nerve sheath tumors, called neurofibromas. They can develop anywhere along the peripheral nerve fibers.

Seventy-five percent of retinoblastomas are unilateral; 60% occur sporadically. A predisposition to retinoblastoma has been associated with 13q14 cytogenetic abnormalities.

PD						Werner Syndrome	A rare, autosomal recessive syndrome caused by mutations in the WRN gene. It is characterized by the appearance of accelerated aging following puberty. It is associated with the development of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cataracts, and cancer.	ncit:C3447		
PD						Cherubism	A rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder usually caused by mutations in the SH3BP2 gene. It is characterized by a prominent lower part of the face due to bilateral replacement of the mandibular or maxillary bones by lesions. The lesions contain osteoclast-like cells admixed with spindle-shaped mononuclear stromal cells. With time, the lesions become more fibrotic and less osteoclast-rich.	ncit:C84630		
PD						Li-Fraumeni	An autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations of the TP53 gene. It is characterized by the development of malignant neoplasms at various anatomic sites.

At the molecular level, high-frequency microsatellite instability is present.	ncit:C8494		
PD						Bloom Syndrome	An autosomal dominant inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

PD						Cabozantinib	An orally bioavailable, small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Cabozantinib strongly binds to and inhibits several RTKs, which are often overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, including hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), RET (rearranged during transfection), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor types 1 (VEGFR-1), 2 (VEGFR-2), and 3 (VEGFR-3), mast/stem cell growth factor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3), TIE-2 (TEK tyrosine kinase, endothelial), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) and AXL. This may result in an inhibition of both tumor growth and angiogenesis, and eventually lead to tumor regression.	ncit:C52200		
PD						Carboplatin	A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties. Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)	ncit:C1282		
PD						Glembatumumab	A human monoclonal antibody against transmembrane glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). Glembatumumab binds to GPNMB on cancer cells, but alone does not appear to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, this antibody could be utilized to deliver a conjugated cytotoxic agent to GPNMB-expressing tumor cells. GPNMB, overexpressed on the surface of various cancer cells, plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation.	ncit:C84520		
PD						Denosumab	A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) with antiosteoclast activity. Denosumab specifically binds to RANKL and blocks the interaction of RANKL with RANK, a receptor located on osteoclast cell surfaces, resulting in inhibition of osteoclast activity, a decrease in bone resorption, and a potential increase in bone mineral density. RANKL, a protein expressed by osteoblastic cells, plays an important role in osteoclastic differentiation and activation.	ncit:C61313		
PD						Dinutuximab	A chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody with potential antineoplastic activity. Dinutuximab binds to the ganglioside GD2 and induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against GD2-expressing tumor cells. GD2 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lung.	ncit:C1570		
PD						Gemcitabine	A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.	ncit:C66876		
PD						Interferon	Human interferons have been classified into 3 groups: alpha, beta, and gamma. Both alpha- and beta-IFNs, previously designated type I, are acid-stable, but they differ immunologically and in regard to some biologic and physiochemical properties. The IFNs produced by virus-stimulated leukocytes (leukocyte IFNs) are predominantly of the alpha type. Those produced by lymphoblastoid cells are about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts produce mainly or exclusively the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ widely in amino acid sequence. The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens or to antigens to which they are sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs.

PD						Docetaxel	A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata. Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response. Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. (NCI04)	ncit:C1526

According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time relationship to medical intervention, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other interventions. The response to withdrawal of the medical product (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.

According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medical intervention, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other medical interventions, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.	ncit:C53259
