Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.	ncit:C53258			
PD						Unlikely	A characteristic used to qualify the adverse event as unlikely related to the medical intervention. According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to the medical intervention which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other interventions or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.	ncit:C53257
