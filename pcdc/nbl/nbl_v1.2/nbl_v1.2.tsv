VD	HISTOLOGY	Code		The study of the structure of the cells and their arrangement to constitute tissues and, finally, the association among these to form organs.  In pathology, the microscopic process of identifying normal and abnormal morphologic characteristics in tissues, by employing various cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains.		_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
PD						Neuroblastoma (Schwannian Stroma-Poor)	Neuroblastoma with minimal or absent Schwannian stroma. This tumor is primarily composed of neuroblasts (immature nerve cells) and is characterized by aggressive behavior and a higher likelihood of metastasis due to the lack of supportive stroma.			
PD						Ganglioneuroblastoma, Intermixed (Schwannian Stroma-Rich)	A type of neuroblastic tumor that contains a mixture of mature ganglion cells and immature neuroblasts within abundant Schwannian stroma. The rich stroma suggests a less aggressive tumor compared to Schwannian stroma-poor neuroblastomas.			
PD						Ganglioneuroma (Schwannian Stroma-Dominant), Maturing Subtype	A benign neuroblastic tumor where Schwannian stroma is the dominant component, and the tumor is composed mainly of mature ganglion cells with minimal or no immature neuroblasts. The maturing subtype indicates the tumor is well-differentiated, resulting in a favorable prognosis.			
PD						Ganglioneuroblastoma, Nodular (Composite)	A neuroblastic tumor with a composite structure featuring both nodular regions of immature neuroblasts and areas with mature ganglion cells within Schwannian stroma. The nodular (composite) pattern can complicate the prognosis and treatment due to the presence of both aggressive and less aggressive components.			
VD	HISTOLOGY_GRADE	Code		The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.	C18000	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
PD						Undifferentiated or Poorly Differentiated	Tumor cells that are undifferentiated or poorly differentiated lack distinct features of the normal tissue from which they originated. They often resemble primitive or immature cells and have an abnormal appearance and behavior. These tumors typically grow faster, are more aggressive, and have a poorer prognosis compared to well-differentiated tumors.			
PD						Differentiating	Tumors that are differentiating contain cells that are in the process of maturing or developing characteristics more typical of the tissue of origin. While not fully mature, these tumors show some level of differentiation and may exhibit intermediate behavior, often with a more favorable prognosis compared to undifferentiated or poorly differentiated tumors.			
PD						Grade 3	Grade 3 is a classification used to describe the aggressiveness of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope and how much they differ from the normal tissue. Grade 3 tumors are considered high-grade, meaning they are poorly differentiated, grow rapidly, and have a higher likelihood of spreading. The high grade reflects a more aggressive cancer with a poorer prognosis compared to lower-grade tumors.			New PD

PD						Favorable	Histology is considered favorable when the tumor cells resemble normal cells of the tissue of origin and exhibit characteristics that are associated with a better prognosis. This includes features such as well-differentiated cells, low mitotic activity, and a lack of aggressive growth patterns. Tumors with favorable histology tend to be less aggressive, respond better to treatment, and have a higher chance of successful treatment outcomes.			
PD						Unfavorable	Histology is considered unfavorable when the tumor cells are poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, exhibiting characteristics that are associated with a worse prognosis. This includes features such as high mitotic activity, aggressive growth patterns, and a lack of resemblance to normal tissue. Tumors with unfavorable histology tend to be more aggressive, harder to treat, and associated with a higher risk of metastasis and poor outcomes.

VD	HONEST_BROKER_SUBJECT_ID	String		The identifier assigned to the subject by the honest broker--an individual, organization or system acting for, or on behalf of, a covered entity to collect and provide health information to research investigators in such a manner whereby it would not be reasonably possible for the investigators or others to identify the corresponding patients-subjects directly or indirectly. The honest broker cannot be one of the investigators. The information provided to the investigators by the honest broker may incorporate linkage codes to permit information collation and/or subsequent inquiries (i.e., a "re-identification code"), however the information linking this re-identification code to the patient's identity must be retained by the honest broker and subsequent inquiries are conducted through the honest broker.	C168949	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		New VD
VD	DISEASE_PHASE	Code		The phase of the cancer treatment process during which relevant observations were recorded. This variable is used across domains to frame the timing of these longitudinal observations and reduce the number of redundant variables needed to report similar concepts (see "Disease Phase Timing and Course Table" in the documentation for additional guidance).	C168878	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
PD						Initial Diagnosis	The first diagnosis of the individual's condition.	C156813

PD						Refractory	Not responding to treatment.	C38014

VD	MOLECULAR_ABNORMALITY	Code		The type of variation detected by this genetic analysis.		_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
PD						MYCN Amplification	An increase in the number of copies of the MYCN gene, resulting in the overexpression of the MYCN protein. MYCN amplification is commonly associated with aggressive neuroblastoma and can be a predictor of poor prognosis and a target for specific therapies.			
VD	GENE1	String		The gene symbol that represents either a single gene that has a mutation or the gene that comprises the 5' portion of the coding sequence involved in a fusion gene mutation.	C173595	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
VD	COPY_NUMBER_STATUS	Code		The status of the copy number.		_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_		
PD						Gain	The acquisition of additional copies of a specific DNA segment, which can include entire chromosomes or smaller DNA regions. In the context of cancer, gains often refer to the increase in the number of copies of chromosomal regions or genes, which can lead to overexpression and tumor development.			
PD						Loss	The decrease in the number of copies of a specific DNA segment, which can include entire chromosomes or smaller chromosomal regions. This can occur through deletions, where a segment of DNA is removed, or through other mechanisms that result in reduced genetic material. Loss of genetic material can lead to the absence of essential genes, loss of gene function, or reduced gene dosage, which can contribute to disease development, including cancer.			
PD						Amplification	Amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a specific DNA segment, which can include genes or chromosomal regions. This genetic alteration results in the overproduction of the gene or genes located within the amplified region. In cancer, gene amplification can lead to the overexpression of oncogenes, which can drive tumor growth and contribute to cancer progression. Amplification is typically identified through genetic testing techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR, or array-based methods.			
PD						No gain/loss/amplification	A genetic variation where gain, loss, or exchange of DNA results in monoallelic loss of function mutations in a diploid cell. In the context of tumor suppressor genes, where a single copy is sufficient for functionality, loss of function for the second allele is associated with tumorigenesis.	C18016
