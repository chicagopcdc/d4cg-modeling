PD						Amplification	Amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a specific DNA segment, which can include genes or chromosomal regions. This genetic alteration results in the overproduction of the gene or genes located within the amplified region. In cancer, gene amplification can lead to the overexpression of oncogenes, which can drive tumor growth and contribute to cancer progression. Amplification is typically identified through genetic testing techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR, or array-based methods.																									
PD						No gain/loss/amplification	A genetic variation where gain, loss, or exchange of DNA results in monoallelic loss of function mutations in a diploid cell. In the context of tumor suppressor genes, where a single copy is sufficient for functionality, loss of function for the second allele is associated with tumorigenesis.	C18016

VD	HONEST_BROKER_SUBJECT_ID	String		The identifier assigned to the subject by the honest broker--an individual, organization or system acting for, or on behalf of, a covered entity to collect and provide health information to research investigators in such a manner whereby it would not be reasonably possible for the investigators or others to identify the corresponding patients-subjects directly or indirectly. The honest broker cannot be one of the investigators. The information provided to the investigators by the honest broker may incorporate linkage codes to permit information collation and/or subsequent inquiries (i.e., a "re-identification code"), however the information linking this re-identification code to the patient's identity must be retained by the honest broker and subsequent inquiries are conducted through the honest broker.
