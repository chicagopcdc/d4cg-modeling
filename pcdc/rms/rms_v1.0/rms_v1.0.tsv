PD						Translocation	Any type of genetic recombination involving exchange of DNA between non-homologous chromosomes, which often occurs as the result of non-homologous end-joining of broken DNA strands. Chromosomal translocation is involved in repairing broken DNA and in maintaining cell viability at the expense of long term genomic stability. This process is is associated with particular types of leukemia, infertility and Down Syndrome.	C25756			
PD						Inversion	A structural change in genomic DNA where the 5' to 3' order of a nucleotide sequence is completely reversed to the 3' to 5' order relative to its adjacent sequences.

An inversion mutation abnormality may be heritable or occur somatically.	C45589			
PD						Mutation	Any transmissible change in the genetic material of an organism, which can result from radiation, viral infection, transposition, treatment with mutagenic chemicals and errors during DNA replication or meiosis. The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes.

Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.	C45576
