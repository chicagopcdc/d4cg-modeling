A consortium launched in 2021 as a collaboration between acute myeloid leukemia researchers from Children's Oncology Group, European Pediatric Acute Leukemia, Japan Children's Cancer Group, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. To date, INTERACT has identified 18 studies from 10 clinical trials research groups that can be contributed to the data commons, and its statisticians are actively working to harmonize clinical data from more than 6,000 individuals who have had pediatric cancer.	ncit:C192762		New PD

VD	HISTOLOGY_GRADE	Enum	2 - contributors should prioritize inclusion if resources are available	The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.	ncit:C18000	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_
