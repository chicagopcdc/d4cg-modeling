PD						Amifostine	The trihydrate form of a phosphorylated aminosulfhydryl compound. After dephosphorylation of amifostine by alkaline phosphatase to an active free sulfhydryl (thiol) metabolite, the thiol metabolite binds to and detoxifies cytotoxic platinum-containing metabolites of cisplatin and scavenges free radicals induced by cisplatin and ionizing radiation. The elevated activity of this agent in normal tissues results from both the relative abundance of alkaline phosphatase in normal tissues and the greater vascularity of normal tissues compared to tumor tissues	ncit:C488
PD						Bleomycin	A mixture of glycopeptide antineoplastic antibiotics isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms complexes with iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA; these reactive oxygen species also induce lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and alterations in prostaglandin synthesis and degradation.	ncit:C313
PD						Carboplatin	A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties. Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)	ncit:C1282
PD						Cisplatin	An alkylating-like inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) with antineoplastic activity. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition	ncit:C376
PD						Cyclophosphamide	A synthetic alkylating agent chemically related to the nitrogen mustards with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities. In the liver, cyclophosphamide is converted to the active metabolites aldophosphamide and phosphoramide mustard, which bind to DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and initiating cell death.	ncit:C405
PD						Dactinomycin	A chromopeptide antineoplastic antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces parvulus. Dactinomycin intercalates between adjacent guanine-cytosine base pairs, blocking the transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase; it also causes single-strand DNA breaks, possibly via a free-radical intermediate or an interaction with topoisomerase II. (NCI04)	ncit:C412
PD						Etoposide	A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic properties, etoposide binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II and its function in ligating cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of single- or double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, and apoptotic cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle. (NCI04)	ncit:C491
PD						Etoposide Phosphate	A phosphate salt of a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin. Etoposide binds to the enzyme topoisomerase II, inducing double-strand DNA breaks, inhibiting DNA repair, and resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and tumor cell proliferation. Cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle are most sensitive to this agent. (NCI04)	ncit:C1093
PD						Gemcitabine	A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in \masked termination\ during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.	ncit:C66876
PD						Ifosfamide	A synthetic analogue of the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide with antineoplastic activity. Ifosfamide alkylates and forms DNA crosslinks, thereby preventing DNA strand separation and DNA replication. This agent is a prodrug that must be activated through hydroxylation by hepatic microsomal enzymes. (NCI04)	ncit:C564
PD						Melphalan	A phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard with antineoplastic activity. Melphalan alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine and induces DNA inter-strand cross-linkages, resulting in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cytotoxicity against both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.	ncit:C633
PD						Paclitaxel	A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia with antineoplastic activity. Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division. This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2). (NCI04)	ncit:C1411
PD						Vinblastine	A natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. Vinblastine binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule formation, resulting in disruption of mitotic spindle assembly and arrest of tumor cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. This agent may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. (NCI04)	ncit:C930
PD						Vincristine	A natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. Vincristine binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.

VD	AE_ATTRIBUTION	Code		A specific identifiable level (defined qualitatively or quantitatively) of probability of adverse event being caused or associated with the product or procedure administration to a patient.	ncit:C41358	_undefined_	_undefined_	_undefined_
PD						Definite	A characteristic used to qualify the adverse event as certainly related to the medical intervention. According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time relationship to medical intervention, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other interventions. The response to withdrawal of the medical product (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.	ncit:C53260
PD						Probable	Probable adverse event relationship to study product or procedure is defined when there is a clear-cut temporal association between product or procedure administration and adverse event, and a potential alternative etiology of the event is not apparent.	ncit:C41357
PD						Possible	A characteristic indicating that an adverse event may be related to the medical intervention. According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.	ncit:C53258
PD						Unlikely	A characteristic used to qualify the adverse event as unlikely related to the medical intervention. According to WHO causality assessment criteria of suspected adverse reactions it is applicable to a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to the medical intervention which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other interventions or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.	ncit:C53257
PD						Unrelated	A characteristic used to qualify the adverse event as clearly not related to the medical intervention.	ncit:C53256
PD						Unknown	Reported as unknown by the data contributor.	ncit:C17998
PD						Not Reported	Not provided or available.	ncit:C43234

PD						Death, Contributory	Any adverse event contributing to the cause of death.	ncit:C168948
PD						Death, Noncontributory	The adverse event did not directly contribute to the death of the subject.	ncit:C173315
PD						Not Yet Recovered	One of the possible results of an adverse event outcome that indicates that the event has not improved or recuperated.	ncit:C49494
PD						Recovered with Sequelae	One of the possible results of an adverse event outcome where the subject recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.	ncit:C49495
PD						Recovered	One of the possible results of an adverse event outcome that indicates that the event has improved or recuperated.	ncit:C49498
